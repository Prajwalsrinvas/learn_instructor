    "1. The code is not working correctly in many cases.\n",
    "2. It often misclassifies valid arguments as invalid, especially for more complex forms like Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens.\n",
    "3. It sometimes reaches the right conclusion (invalid argument) but for the wrong reasons, classifying logical fallacies or weak inductive arguments as having unsound premises.\n",
    "4. It incorrectly validates some invalid arguments, such as the Non Sequitur and the Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle.\n",
    "5. The reasoner seems to have difficulty distinguishing between soundness (truth of premises) and validity (logical structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the logical reasoner, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Refine the logic for recognizing valid argument forms, especially Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens.\n",
    "2. Implement better distinction between logical validity and soundness of premises.\n",
    "3. Add capability to recognize common logical fallacies.\n",
    "4. Improve handling of inductive vs. deductive reasoning.\n",
    "5. Enhance the system's ability to analyze more complex, multi-step arguments.\n",
